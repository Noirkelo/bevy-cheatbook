# Entities

[See here for more explanation on how storing data in the ECS works.][cb::ecs-intro-data]

Conceptually, an entity represents a set of values for different components.
Each component is a Rust type (`struct` or `enum`) and an entity can be used to
store a value of that type.

Technically, an entity is just a simple integer ID (imagine the "row number" in
a table/spreadsheet) that can be used to find related data values (in different
"columns" of that table).

In Bevy, [`Entity`][bevy::Entity] is this value. It consists of two integers:
the ID and the "generation" (allowing IDs to be reused, after you despawn old
entities).

You can create ("spawn") new entities and destroy ("despawn") entities using
[`Commands`][cb::commands] or [exclusive `World` access][cb::world].

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/programming/ec.rs:spawn-despawn}}
```

Many of your entities might need to have the same common components. You can use
[Bundles][cb::bundle] to make it easier to spawn your entities.

# Components

Components are the data associated with entities.

To create a new component type, simply define a Rust `struct` or `enum`, and
derive the [`Component`][bevy::Component] trait.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/programming/ec.rs:component}}
```

Types must be unique â€“ an entity can only have one component per Rust type.

## Newtype Components

Use wrapper (newtype) structs to make unique components out of simpler types:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/programming/ec.rs:component-newtype}}
```

## Marker Components

You can use empty structs to help you identify specific entities. These are
known as "marker components". Useful with [query filters][cb::query-filter].

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/programming/ec.rs:component-marker}}
```

## Accessing Components

Components can be accessed from [systems][cb::system], using [queries][cb::query].

You can think of the query as the "specification" for the data you want to access.
It will search for entities that match and give you access to the data.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/programming/ec.rs:query}}
```

## Adding/removing Components

You can add/remove components on existing entities, using [`Commands`][cb::commands] or
[exclusive `World` access][cb::world].

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/programming/ec.rs:insert-remove}}
```
