# Text Editor / IDE

This sub-chapter contains tips for different text editors and IDEs.

Bevy is, for the most part, like any other Rust project. If your editor/IDE
is set up for Rust, that might be all you need. This sub-chapter contains
additional information that may be useful for Bevy specifically.

If you have any tips/advice/configurations for your editor of choice,
that you'd like to share with the community, please create a
[GitHub Issue][project::cb::issues], so we can add it to the book.
If your editor is not in the list, I will add it.
